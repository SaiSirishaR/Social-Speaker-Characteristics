   <h4 align="center"> Abstract: </h4>
  <font size="4"> We analyze the social speaker characteristics of Text-to-Speech (TTS) voices with respect to the application domains health care and customer service. It is essential that these voices exhibit certain domain-specific psychological speaker characteristics such as warmth and competence in the generated speech. However, a systematic strategy for the perception of these characteristics from synthetic voices is unknown. Therefore, we perform a 3-stage evaluation of TTS systems in order to reach the perceptual aspects contributing to the targeted characteristics. A discussion on the findings of each evaluation stage, i) pre-tests conducted for speaker selection, ii) questionnaire preparation and iii) Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), comparison of our results with that of the natural speech is presented. Through this work, we further propose the perceptual dimensions to be evaluated for each of warmth and competence in TTS voices. Our analysis shows that additionally, we have also obtained the dimensions underlying the personality trait, Extraversion in the current study.</font></h4>
